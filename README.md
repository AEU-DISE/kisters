## WaterQuality
The WQ folder attempts to join our YSI data from Lower Trophic with WDL data based on date and station. 

## Fish 
The Fish Data folder puts our Access fish tables into the format desired by WISKI. Since I wrote this code there has been more fish data entered into Access so all the files will need to be updated. I have also updated some things in the Fish Publication, so you will likely want to use some combination of the two sets of cleaning files for the eventual export, or do something else.
